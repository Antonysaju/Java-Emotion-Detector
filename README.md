# Java-Emotion-Detector
A Java Application that attempts to detect the emotion that a user is feeling, using the input he/she provides to the system. The application has a mySQL database on PhpMyAdmin that consists of a large word base that is classified into different emotions, it has a user interface that is created using SWING, and the application itself is created on Apache Netbeans.

Future Expansion: I aim to expand this project by including relevant advice based on the emotion detected, making the application seem more like a "real" virtual friend. With more expertise, the project could also be expanded and made into an online therapist bot, which recognizes emotions from the users narrations and provides valuable feedback to improve mental health and also provide feedback to allow users to learn about and from their own mistakes.
